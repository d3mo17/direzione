# Direzione

A browser based application to manage a martial arts tournament.
In its early state, it can handle a playlist of opponents and displays the scoring by a scoreboard.

### Features / Structure / Interface

* AMD-, CommonJS and global-support

### Installation

```shell
    $ npm install direzione
    $ npx direzione-fit
```

### API documentation
[API of Direzione](api.md)


## Scoreboard Example

This example shows how a scoreboard can be controlled by persons sitting at the referee table.

## How to use

It is important to execute all installation steps mentioned above, before direzione is ready to use.
Open file `scoreboard_gui.html` in a browser window and file `remote_scorboard.html` in another browser window.
You can also open `all_in_one_demo.html` instead. This file uses frames to load the other two documents in one browser window, so you can see what happens at a glance.

## Connection Technique

The connection beetween `scoreboard_gui.html` and `remote_scorboard.html` will be handled trough WebRTC. The connection will be triggered by clicking the red button in the right upper corner of the scoreboard GUI. If the connection become established, the background color of the button changes to green.

### Troubleshooting

The ability to connect between scoreboards depends on a configured network. If you are not connected to a network, to get it work, you have to setup an ip address to your computer manually.

If you use a chromium based browser and the connection between the scoreboards will not get established (even if your computers network is configured), then move to "chrome://flags" and disable Option "Anonymize local IPs exposed by WebRTC" - try again afterwards!
After the connection between scoreboards was established once, you can switch the Option back.
